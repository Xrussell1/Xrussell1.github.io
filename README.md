## Welcome to My Final Portfolio Project 
<p style="color:red;" 
You can acess my most recent project here (https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories/b2a5756d-c6f9-4639-a36c-0ce981a00b31)
My non-linear game is a way to show off my abilities with the Twine software as well as to structure a story in which there were many options for each step that could lead you in a variety of ways. In turn, this leads you further away from the storyline and from completing the game.

  <h2> Project Two: Green Screen</h2>
  <p style="color:red;">
     To complete project one, I used zoom software to simulate the effects you would receive while using a video editing program like OBS. The purpose of this project was to modify the viewer's perception. By making a loop of myself passing back and forth as I was on the computer, I was able to achieve the green screen effect for my zoom background. In doing so, I was able to alter the viewer's perception in a subtle way.

<h3> Project One: Github Poetry </h3>
<p style="color:red;"> 
  I learned about generative web art through the process of using uncreative writing within this project. As part of this project, I searched for the phrase "How do you feel?" I pasted this phrase in the text editor and received a number of images related to feelings. As a result, I decided to dedicate my poem to the feelings and well-being of the person I was originally sending the text too.
