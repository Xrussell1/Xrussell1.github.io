## Welcome to My Final Portfolio Project 

You can acess my most recent project here (https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories/b2a5756d-c6f9-4639-a36c-0ce981a00b31)
My non-linear game is a way to show off my abilities with the Twine software as well as to structure a story in which there were many options for each step that could lead you in a variety of ways. In turn, this leads you further away from the storyline and from completing the game.
